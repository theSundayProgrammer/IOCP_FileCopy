This sample application demonstrates the use of IO Completion ports. A thread pool using completion port queues is first created and then file handles are associated with the completion port. The on successful read an asynchronous write function is launched. Usually nothing needs to be done on write completion but if there are too many read tasks then you you may want to stagger the read tasks on part completion of write.
